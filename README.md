Memory Allocation Timing in C++
This project measures how long it takes to dynamically allocate different sizes of memory blocks using malloc() in C++. Itâ€™s useful for observing how memory allocation time scales with size.

ðŸ“‹ What It Does
Allocates memory blocks from 1 byte up to 9,000,000 bytes, increasing in steps of 100,000 bytes.

Measures the time (in milliseconds) it takes to allocate each block.

Prints the size and duration for each allocation.
